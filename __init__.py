"""Arkul- An html replacement.

* Arkul does not stand for anything, it is merely a name.

Arkul is a compiled markup language, designed to replace html.
It allows for nicer markup, reading from files (at compile time),
and defining constants. Python functions can be used as well. 
see README.rst for more details.
